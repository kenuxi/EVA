## your overall plan
- Project definition: 

### Interactive data visualization for anomaly detection

Anomaly detection is a subfield of AI that detects anomalies in datasets. A
machine learning algorithm learns the "patterns" that the majority of cases
adhere to and then singles out the few cases that deviate from those normal
patterns. Appropriate projections of the high-dimensional datasets to two
dimensions often help by isolating anomalies in the image of those projections.
The anomalies can then easily be spotted by a human just by looking at the
image. There are many different techniques with different strengths and
weaknesses.
Your job would be to develop a modular, extensible anomaly visualization
framework with graphical user interface that allows to evaluate different data
visualizations techniques on user provided datasets. Time series datasets
should be paid particular attention to.


### possible implementation
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Plotly Dash  
- Web App using Flask  
- Apache Superset as base and vis, change to accept data files and run Algs  


  
## your project management 
### Tasks
- Research Superset as possible alternative:  Kenneth
- Plotly Dash, IRIS Data preparation:         Rocco
- Prepare sample of Plotly Dash:              Uttam
- PCA into plotly dash:                       Alberto


## tools you will use
- Jupyter
- Plotly dash
- Apache Superset (https://superset.incubator.apache.org/)
- matplot

## Data
- MNIST
- IRIS

## splitting up the requirements into tasks (at least the first ones)

## assignment of exactly one person to each task

Week 1: Research 

Week 2: More specific research into Visualisation Frameworks -> Define Milestones

Week 3: Create First demo prototype using sample data

Week 4: Implemting MNIST and anomaly detection

Week 5: ...
