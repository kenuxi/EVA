## your overall plan
- Project definition: 

### Interactive data visualization for anomaly detection

Anomaly detection is a subfield of AI that detects anomalies in datasets. A
machine learning algorithm learns the "patterns" that the majority of cases
adhere to and then singles out the few cases that deviate from those normal
patterns. Appropriate projections of the high-dimensional datasets to two
dimensions often help by isolating anomalies in the image of those projections.
The anomalies can then easily be spotted by a human just by looking at the
image. There are many different techniques with different strengths and
weaknesses.
Your job would be to develop a modular, extensible anomaly visualization
framework with graphical user interface that allows to evaluate different data
visualizations techniques on user provided datasets. Time series datasets
should be paid particular attention to.


### implementation
- Flask + Plotly Dash

### Requirements firts Prototype 
- Upload a CSV
- Configuration Screen
- Data preview
- Run PCA & T-SNE
- Visualise Plotly Dash


## your project management 
### Tasks
- Generating Anomalines to CSV files      ->Rocco
- Handling PCA application to Datasets    ->Alberto
- Build Flask Backend and Homepage        ->Kenneth
- Start implementing Docker               ->Rocco
- Git & Team Management                   ->Uttam
- T-SNE implementation                    ->Alberto
- Plot from uploaded CSV                  ->Uttam


## Data
- IRIS dataset changed to have anomaly
- MNIST dataset changed to have anomaly

## splitting up the requirements into tasks (at least the first ones)

## assignment of exactly one person to each task

Week 1: Research 

Week 2: More specific research into Visualisation Frameworks -> Define Milestones

Week 3: Create First demo prototype using sample data

Week 4-5: Running first prototype, including Flask, applying at least T-SNE, PCA
