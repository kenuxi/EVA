# Protocol of the meeting on 18.05

- presented research, exclusion of Superset, Jupyter as solutions
- Plotly and Plotly dash as final solution for now
- presented prototype and functionality goal in 14 days from now (as in README)

## Comments from Boris
- Project name is now EVA (**E**valuation and **V**isualisation of **A**nomalies)
- Start working with Anomaly datasets, IRIS + MNIST right away
- How does plotly scale with large amounts of data?
- PCA will be more difficult to visualize
- T-SNE is an iterative process and will be difficult with more than 10k datapooints -> check how well it scales
- Vis types to pay special attention to:
1. Scatter
2. Histogram (k-nearest neighbour)
3. Tree (hierarchy clustering)
4. Keppler -> S-Graph

** It is very important to document our research of other Algorithms and Vis. Libraries and hand them in to Boris**
