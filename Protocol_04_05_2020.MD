# Protocol of the meeting on 04.05

## TODOs for the meeting (Boris's email from 27.04) were handled in following manner:

- overall plan
    * Week 1: Research

    * Week 2: More specific research into Visualisation Frameworks -> Define Milestones

    * Week 3: Create First basic demo prototype using sample data

    * Week 4: Implemting MNIST and anomaly detection

    * Week 5: ... to follow

- project management

    * we have a WhatsApp group and a slack channel to communicate. WhatsApp is used for prompt messaging, while slack is used for file sharing e.t.c. We also had a jitsi meeting with all the members before the meeting with Boris. We want to continue this behaviour throughout the project

- tools to be used

    * Jupyter notebook

    * Plotly Dash

    * Apache Superset (Kenneth will explore the functionality first)

- splitting up the requirements into tasks (at least the first ones)

    * Research Superset as possible alternative: Kenneth
    * Plotly Dash, IRIS Data preparation: Rocco
    * Prepare sample of Plotly Dash: Uttam
    * PCA into plotly dash: Alberto

- assignment of exactly one person to each task
    * see above

## Points from the meeting

- agreed  that it probably is best to mix plotly dash and apche superset, if possible

- will need another week to have detailed project milestones

- agreed to first test with small basic dataset and build on that

- Boris explained how to create a anomaly datset out of labelled dataset, for e.g. for MNIST.

       1. take all images with digit 0 as normal
       2. take a random portion( at most 1%) of 1-9 and mark them as anomalies

- Boris also mention publicly available dataset used mainly for anomaly detection i.e, "credit fraud dataset"

- Also had some organisational talking about Qispos registration with the conclusion that it is better to directly talk to Tobias regarding the issue
